The kvartiri.bg web application is a platform that helps users find rooms for rent and allows property owners to list their properties for rent. Users can communicate with property owners, update their profiles, and interact seamlessly with the platform.

## Technologies Used

- **Django Framework**: The core of the web application is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework.

- **Class Factories**: Class factories are employed to generate class-based views, enhancing code modularity and maintainability.

- **Decorators**: Custom decorators are used to modify the dispatch method, allowing for fine-grained control over request handling.

- **Mixins**: Mixins are utilized to share and reuse common methods across multiple classes, reducing code duplication.

- **Tailwind CSS**: The frontend is styled using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, for a modern and responsive design.
